## Description
This repository is intended for those who want the pterodactyl panel [Translation System](http://pterodactylmarket.com/resource/309) to support multiple languages.
If you want to support the addon by adding a new translation, you are more than welcome.

## How to help?

**1 -** First, start forking this repository.
<br>
**2 -** Then create the file for your respective language.<br>
**3 -** After creating the file correctly (**remember that the file must be in .js format**), you will open the `language.js` file that is in your fork and copy the contents of it completely into your file, then just translate it into another language.
<br>
**4 -** Once you've completed your translation file, you can save everything to your fork and create a Pull Request.
<br>
**5 -** You finished!

## Attention!

In some messages in the translation file, you will find 2 braces ```{{}}```.<br>
Please keep the key names as they are, do not translate what is inside the keys.
